Creates a new buffer showing the differences using

DIFFS is a list of alists, each with :old, :new and :file keys, as
returned by `agent-shell--make-diff-infos'.  A single diff is passed as
a one-element list.  When DIFFS holds more than one file, each is shown
as its own section preceded by a header naming the file.

Returns the newly created diff buffer.

Arguments:

Codex sends the edited region), so the hunk's line numbers are relative

the file for the changed content.  When ACP reports a `locations' line

point sits on a body line, lands on that line's content.  Searches for
